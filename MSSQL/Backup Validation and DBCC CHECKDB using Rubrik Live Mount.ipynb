    "## Backup Validatation of a database using Live Mount\n",
    "\n",
    "Live mount allows for near instant recovery of a database. If a database restore/export normally takes hours, then live mounting a database will take a few minutes. Live Mount does a full recovery of a database to either the same SQL Server Instance with a different database name or another SQL Server Instance with the same or different database name. The recovery of the database is much faster, because Rubrik does not need to copy the contents of the backup from the Rubrik Cluster back to the SQL Server. All of the recovery work is done on the Rubrik cluster itself. Then the database files are presented to the SQL Server Instance via a secure SMB3 share that is only accessible by the machine the share is mounted to.\n",

    "- DevOps Automation\n",
    "- Reporting databases\n",
    "- Database migration application smoke test validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key parameter is RecoveryDateTime. All dates in Rubrik are stored in UTC format. This parameter is expecting a fully qualified date and time in UTC format. example value is 2018-08-01T02:00:00.000Z. In the example below, we are pulling the latest recovery point that Rubrik knows about.\n",
